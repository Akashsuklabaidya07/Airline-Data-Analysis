Hii everyone
 This is my latest project where I delved into data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization using a flight dataset! 📊
 Through this project, I focused on:
🔍 Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset was accurate, complete, and ready for analysis.
📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering key patterns, trends, and insights.
🎨 Data Visualization: Creating compelling visual representations to make data insights easily understandable.
Here are some of the key insights I discovered:

Insight 1:The most expansive Airlines are Jet Airways Business, Jet Airways,Multiple carries,Air India etc
Insight 2:The most busiest destinations in India are Delhi, Kolkata, Banglore, mumbai etc
Insight 3:The no of total stops of Jet Airways is maximum 2535, Indigo 1231 etc
